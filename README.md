# TorchVision Object Detection and Finetuning 

This project provides an implementation of object detection and instance segmentation using a pre-trained Mask R-CNN model available in TorchVision. It is designed to demonstrate how to fine-tune a pre-trained model for custom datasets like the Penn-Fudan Database for Pedestrian Detection and Segmentation.

The covers all essential steps, including dataset preparation, model configuration, and training pipeline setup. It explains how to structure your dataset, modify the model's head for specific classes, and evaluate performance using metrics like IoU (Intersection over Union) and pixel accuracy. The codebase is modular, allowing easy customization for different datasets and detection tasks.

By following this , you will learn how to adapt pre-trained models for object detection and segmentation tasks, effectively utilizing TorchVision's powerful tools. This serves as an excellent starting point for building real-world applications such as autonomous systems, medical imaging analysis, or custom object detection pipelines.
